ATTINY 84 Getting Started
=========================

Preferences>Additional Boards Manager URLs
Add
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damellis/attiny/ide-1.6.x-boards-manager/package_damellis_attiny_index.json


Sketch>Include Library>Manage Library select attiny

Don't wire to ATtiny yet you need to upload the ArduinoISP sketch just like any
other program. So Tools>Board>ArduinoUno then File>Examples>ArduinoISP and
upload to the board.

Now the Uno is programmed so we can

Tools>Programmer>Arduino as ISP

Tools>Board>ATTIny24/44/84

Tools>Processor>ATtiny84

Wire Up

Pin 1 on ATTINY 84A bottom left if nothch is facing left. Mine has a triangle
also showing pin 1. Pin 2 is next to it pin 8 is opposite pin 7, pin 14
opposite pin 1.

* Wire Arduino Uno +5V to ATtiny84 Pin 1 (vcc)
* Uno pin 10 to ATtiny pin 4 (reset)
* Uno pin 11 to ATtiny pin 7 (MOSI)
* Uno pin 12 to ATtiny pin 8 (MISO)
* Uno pin 13 to ATtiny pin 9 (SCK)
* Uno GND to ATtiny pin 14 (GND)
* Uno RESET to 10uF cap then cap to GND

| Uno Pin | ATtiny84 Pin |
| :------ | :----------- |
| +5V     | 1 (vcc)      |
| 10      | 4 (reset)    |
| 11      | 7 (MOSI)     |
| 12      | 8 (MISO)     |
| 13      | 9 (SCK)      |
| GND     | 14 (GND)     |
| RESET   | 10uF cap then cap to GND |

Now load an example like blink and upload. The Uno will send it to the ATtiny.

To run at 8mhz Tools>Clock>8MHz Internal

Tools>Burn Bootloader

Then upload a sketch
